This directory contains the extracted feature data and labels for the data of 15 users.
The data is divided into the training set, validations set, and test set.
The features are in order as

1-32: Discrete wavelet transform coefficients of the x-axis acceleration (Forward direction)
33-64: Discrete wavelet transform coefficients of the y-axis acceleration (Vertical direction)
65: Mean of the z-axis acceleration (Lateral direction)
66-97: Discrete wavelet transform coefficients of the body acceleration
98: Variance of the x-axis acceleration (Forward direction)
99: Variance of the y-axis acceleration (Vertical direction)
100: Variance of the z-axis acceleration (Lateral direction)
101: Variance of the body acceleration
102-117: FFT coefficients of the stretch sensor
118: Maximum value of the stretch sensor
119: Minimum value of the stretch sensor
120: Duration of the window in seconds
121: Activity in the previous window

Please note that all the features have been normalized such that they have zero mean.

The labels for each window is present in the corresponding labels.csv file. The labels are numbered
as below:
1 - Drive
2 - Jump
3 - Lie down
4 - Sit
5 - Stand
6 - Walk
7 - Transition between the above
